Project Structure The hands on project on Classification of COVID19 using Chest X-ray Images in Keras is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Introduction & Import Libraries Introduction to the purpose of the project and the dataset. Introduction to the Rhyme interface. Import the necessary libraries

Task 2: Clone and Explore dataset Clone the X-ray dataset from the Github repository Assign path to the directories Get the total number of images present in different sets.

Task 3: Data Visualization Visualize a grid of 16 images from the dataset

Task 4: Data preprocessing and Augmentation Perform data normalization and augmentation Generate training , validation and testing batches

Task 5: Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Build a convolutional neural network from scratch

Task 6: Compile and Train the Model Compile the model Train the model

Task 7: Performance Evaluation Plot the graph between the training loss and the validation loss Plot the graph between the training and the validation accuracy Test the model on the test data

Task 8: Prediction on New Data Upload random images from the local system. Use of the trained model to predict COVID infected patients on the image
